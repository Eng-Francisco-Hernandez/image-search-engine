## Reflection

This was a personal project to build an application that works as an image search engine to look up for pictures of some topic in particular using the Unsplash API as main source of data. Helpful to search public images quickly whenever it is needed.

The main programming language being used is TypeScript, and the technologies used to build the project are React, CSS/SASS and Bootstrap.

The project also counts with a GitHub workflow that automatically deploys the built application using Github Pages whenever a new pull-request is opened to a release branch.
